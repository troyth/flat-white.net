	<p>Leong Leong is an award-winning design firm based in New York. Leong Leong is focused on projects that envision new relationships between culture and commerce, public and private, figure and field, domestic and monumental, diagram and effect. The studio’s interests are not defined by a particular project type, but by the potential to create environments and artifacts with cultural resonance. Leong Leong’s design process and research is driven by a curiosity for new organization typologies and aesthetic experiences, which offer new ways of living, working, and interacting with one another. Frequently expanding the role of the designer with a diverse staff of designers and researchers, Leong Leong’s approach spans between strategic thinking and material experimentation<wbr>, from the city to the artifact.</p>
<p>Leong Leong’s work includes a wide range of projects and scales including buildings, interiors, exhibitions, and furniture, with completed projects in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Venice, and Napa Valley. In 2010, the American Institute of Architects selected Leong Leong for its New Practices award, and&nbsp;<em>Architectural Record</em>&nbsp;magazine featured Leong Leong as one of seven emerging design firms from around the world in their annual Design Vanguard issue in 2011. They were also awarded a grant by the New York Council of the Arts in 2013, and in the following year, Leong Leong designed the U.S. Pavilion for the 14th Venice Biennale in 2014. Most recently, Leong Leong won The Architectural League’s Emerging Voices Award of 2017. Notable projects include the design for the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Anita May Rosenstein Campus in Hollywood, California, and a new workspace for Triple Canopy, a non-profit arts organization in New York. Other current projects include a ground-up, co-working and hospitality project in San Francisco and an exhibition design for the Bass Museum in Miami.</p>
